Lifecycle
* For each game tile, if it's falling (need to check the falling speed here, should that be the fps?) check
	* If there's no tile below them, move them down
	* If they match the block below them, shatter them both
	* If they're a top shell, check for a matching bottom shell
		* If found, shatter everything in between
		* Else just shatter it
	* If they're over the top, Game over
	* If there is a block below them, place it and stop it from falling
